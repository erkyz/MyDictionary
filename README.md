# MyDictionary
This is a project for PennApps Fall 2015.

## What does this thing do?
Highlights words you may not know. If you select text, it'll give you the
definition, which actually might be obnoxious if you select text for any other
reason. Prints free money. Snape kills Dumbledore.

and Eric Zhu.
